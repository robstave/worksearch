## Project Overview

**WorkSearch** is a job application tracking app with a Kanban board UI, responsive design, and analytics.

- **Stack**: NestJS (API) + React/Vite (Web) + PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Auth**: Session cookies with express-session, avatar dropdown with role-based access
- **State Machine**: Applications flow through: INTERESTED → APPLIED → SCREENING → INTERVIEW (1/2/3) → OFFER → (ACCEPTED|DECLINED|REJECTED|GHOSTED|TRASH)
- **Responsive**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile with breakpoint at 1024px

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Prisma 6** (not 7) - v7 has breaking ESM changes, driver adapters
2. **Simple tags** - Using `tagsList String[]` not relational tags (faster MVP)
3. **Session auth** - Not JWT; simpler for single-user local app
4. **Tailwind 4** - Required `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `postcss.config.cjs`

## State Machine Rules

```
INTERESTED → APPLIED, TRASH
APPLIED → SCREENING, REJECTED, GHOSTED, TRASH
SCREENING → INTERVIEW, REJECTED, GHOSTED, TRASH
INTERVIEW → INTERVIEW_2, OFFER, REJECTED, GHOSTED, TRASH
INTERVIEW_2 → INTERVIEW_3, OFFER, REJECTED, GHOSTED, TRASH
INTERVIEW_3 → OFFER, REJECTED, GHOSTED, TRASH
OFFER → ACCEPTED, DECLINED, REJECTED, GHOSTED
ACCEPTED → (terminal)
DECLINED → (terminal)
REJECTED → (terminal)
GHOSTED → (terminal)
TRASH → (terminal)
```

## Common Tasks

### Add a new API endpoint

1. Create/update DTO in `apps/api/src/<module>/dto/`
2. Add method to service in `apps/api/src/<module>/<module>.service.ts`
3. Add route to controller in `apps/api/src/<module>/<module>.controller.ts`
4. Add to frontend API client in `apps/web/src/api.ts`

### Add a new page

1. Create component in `apps/web/src/pages/`
2. Add route in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
3. Add nav link in `apps/web/src/Layout.tsx` (if needed)

### Modify database schema

```bash
# Edit apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma, then:
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>
```

### Reset database

```bash
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate reset --force
docker compose exec api npx prisma db seed
```

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- TypeScript in API container sometimes needs `touch` to trigger recompile
- After Prisma schema changes, may need `docker compose restart api`
- Frontend uses `verbatimModuleSyntax` - must use `import type` for types
