## 🔧 Development

### Running Locally (without Docker)

```bash
# API
cd apps/api
npm install
npm run start:dev

# Web (in another terminal)
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database Commands

```bash
# Run migrations
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate dev

# Reset database (⚠️ destroys data)
docker compose exec api npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Seed default users
docker compose exec api npm run db:seed

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
docker compose exec api npx prisma studio
```

### Backup & Restore

**⚠️ Important:** Always backup before running migrations or resets!

```bash
# Create a backup
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres worksearch > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Restore from backup (⚠️ will overwrite current data)
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres worksearch < backup-20260206-210000.sql

# Quick backup before risky operations
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres worksearch > backup-before-migration.sql
```

### Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f api   # Backend logs
docker compose logs -f web   # Frontend logs
docker compose logs -f db    # Database logs
```
